## LfgSwap  

LFGSwap is a community-driven organization built to solve what might be called the "liquidity problem." One could define this problem as the inability of disparate forms of liquidity to connect with markets in a decentralized way, and vice versa. While other solutions provide incrementally progressive advances toward solving the problem of liquidity, LfgSwap’s progress is intended to create a broader range of network effects. Rather than limiting itself to a single solution, LfgSwap intertwines many decentralized markets and instruments.

## Buisness Development of Project：

LFGSwap has officially reached a strategic cooperation with EthereumPow, and LFGSwap will become the leading decentralized exchange on EthereumPow. LFGSwap will support the construction of more high-quality projects in the EthereumPow ecosystem, and LFGSwap will become the preferred swap for many projects to build in EthereumPow
